# Architecture/Design Specification

## System Overview

The zero-knowledge data integrity audit system provides cryptographic verification of dataset integrity while preserving complete privacy of authentication paths. The system employs STARK (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) proofs to enable verification without revealing sensitive Merkle tree sibling hashes.

## Architectural Framework

### Core Components

**1. Frontend Interface (React/TypeScript)**
- User interface for dataset upload and audit configuration
- Real-time visualization of audit results and performance metrics
- Interactive parameter selection for confidence levels and corruption detection rates

**2. Backend Orchestration (FastAPI/Python)**
- RESTful API server coordinating audit workflows
- Statistical sampling algorithms for probabilistic verification
- Integration layer between frontend and cryptographic verification system

**3. Cryptographic Verification Engine (Rust)**
- STARK proof generation and verification implementation
- Merkle tree authentication path validation
- High-precision performance measurement and tampering detection

### Privacy-Preserving Architecture

**Traditional Merkle Verification Limitations:**
- Requires revelation of all sibling hashes in authentication paths
- Privacy loss: `path_length × 32_bytes × num_blocks` of sensitive data exposed
- Complete tree structure potentially reconstructible from revealed paths

**Zero-Knowledge STARK Approach:**
- Cryptographic proofs of authentication path validity without revelation
- Zero sibling hashes disclosed during verification process
- Computational integrity maintained with complete path confidentiality

## Cryptographic Design

### STARK Proof System

**Arithmetic Circuit Construction:**
Merkle path verification encoded as arithmetic circuit over finite field F_p where p is a large prime. The circuit validates:
- Hash computations: `H(left_child || right_child) = parent_node`
- Path traversal: Correct navigation from leaf to root following authentication path
- Root verification: Final computation matches committed root hash

**Polynomial Commitment Scheme:**
- FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proofs) for polynomial commitments
- Security parameter λ = 128 bits ensuring 2^(-128) soundness error
- Proof size: O(log²(circuit_size)) bytes independent of tree height

**Verification Protocol:**
1. **Prover** constructs arithmetic circuit representing Merkle path verification
2. **Prover** commits to witness polynomial encoding authentication path
3. **Verifier** challenges polynomial commitment using Fiat-Shamir heuristic
4. **Prover** provides opening proofs satisfying verifier challenges
5. **Verifier** accepts if all polynomial consistency checks pass

### Security Analysis

**Completeness:** Valid authentication paths always generate accepting proofs
**Soundness:** Invalid paths cannot generate accepting proofs except with negligible probability
**Zero-Knowledge:** Verifier learns nothing about authentication path beyond its validity
**Post-Quantum Security:** STARK proofs resist quantum adversaries unlike RSA/ECDSA

## Statistical Audit Framework

### Probabilistic Verification Model

The system implements statistical sampling based on hypergeometric distribution:

**Sample Size Calculation:**
```
n = ⌈log(α) / log(1 - δ)⌉
```
Where:
- n = required sample size
- α = acceptable failure probability (1 - confidence_level)
- δ = minimum corruption rate to detect

**Confidence Guarantees:**
- 95% confidence level: 95% probability of detecting ≥5% corruption with calculated sample
- 99% confidence level: 99% probability of detecting ≥1% corruption with calculated sample

### Performance Requirements

**Latency Constraints:**
- Individual block verification: <100ms including proof generation
